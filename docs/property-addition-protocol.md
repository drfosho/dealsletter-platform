# DealsLetter Property Addition Protocol

## CRITICAL: This document must be referenced every time properties are added to the dashboard

## CRITICAL: NO "N/A" RULE

**NEVER use "N/A" for any financial data when information is provided in the analysis.**

### Required Calculations for 30-Year Projections:
- If property analysis provides income data → Calculate 30-year projections
- If property analysis provides cap rates → Use for value projections  
- If property analysis provides growth assumptions → Apply them
- If property analysis provides exit strategies → Model them

### Standard Assumptions When Not Specified:
- Rent growth: 3% annually
- Expense growth: 2.5% annually
- Appreciation: 4% annually
- Vacancy rate: 5%

### Property Type Guidelines:
- RENTALS: Full 30-year projections required
- FLIPS: Show profit timeline only (no 30-year needed)
- HOUSE HACKS: Show transition from house hack to full rental

### Required Field Names for Display Components:
- Use `netOperatingIncome` not `noi` or `annualNOI`
- Use `cashFlow` not `annualCashFlow`
- Exit strategies must include: `strategy`, `description`, `timeline`, `estimatedProfit`
- Rent analysis must include: `currentRentPerUnit`, `marketRentPerUnit`, `monthlyRentUpside`

**REMEMBER: Your job is to CALCULATE, not to use "N/A" placeholders!**

### CRITICAL REMINDER
If the analysis mentions it, include it. Nothing should be summarized away or marked as "N/A". The goal is to showcase the COMPLETE investment opportunity as analyzed in the original breakdown.

These analyses are comprehensive and detailed - the dashboard properties should reflect that same level of depth and completeness.
