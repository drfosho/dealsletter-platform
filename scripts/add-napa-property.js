  strategicOverview: `This is a rare house hack opportunity in the heart of Napa Valley. With just $28,875 down using an FHA loan, you can control a property with three income-producing units plus a warehouse with massive potential. The strategy is simple: live in one studio while renting the main house and other studio for $5,600/month, covering most of your housing costs. The real opportunity lies in the warehouse conversion - add an ADU and you'll actually get PAID to live in downtown Napa. This property offers multiple exit strategies and income optimization paths in one of California's most desirable wine country locations.`,
  
  valueAddDescription: `The warehouse conversion is the hidden goldmine. For approximately $100k (financeable through HELOC after year 1), convert to a legal ADU renting for $2,500/month. Additional value-adds include: Airbnb arbitrage on weekends ($300/night), wine country event hosting ($1,000+ per event), commercial warehouse rental to winemakers ($1,500/month), or wine storage business ($2,000/month). The two-building configuration provides incredible flexibility for various income strategies.`,
