   Attempting Claude API call (attempt 1/3)
   Using model: claude-opus-4-20250514
   Claude API response time: XXXms
   Successfully parsed property data
   ```

2. **Parsed Property Data**
   ```
   === PARSED PROPERTY DATA ===
   Basic Fields: {title, address, city, state, price}
   Strategic Overview: "This 1925-vintage Nob Hill apartment building..."
   Value Add Description: "The property's 50% vacancy presents..."
   Location Analysis: {overview: "...", walkScore: 98, ...}
   Rent Analysis: {currentRentPerUnit: 2100, marketRentPerUnit: 3200, ...}
   Property Metrics: {pricePerSqft: 465, pricePerUnit: 329167, ...}
   Financing Scenarios: [{name: "Traditional Bank Financing", ...}, ...]
   30-Year Projections: {assumptions: {...}, projections: [...]}
   ```

3. **Modal Opening**
   ```
   Setting review data with parsed data: {full property object}
   Opening modal with data: {full property object}
   ```

4. **Modal Receiving Data**
   ```
   ComprehensiveReviewModal: Received data: {full property object}
   Strategic Overview exists: true
   Location Analysis exists: true
   Rent Analysis exists: true
   Financing Scenarios count: 3

   ```

## Troubleshooting

### If data is not showing in modal tabs:

1. **Check for errors in console**
   - Red error messages indicate API or parsing issues
   - Check if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in .env.local

2. **Verify data structure**
   - Look for "Strategic Overview exists: false" logs
   - This means the AI didn't generate that section

3. **Check modal state**
   - The modal should show checkmarks (âœ“) next to tabs with data
   - Basic Info tab should always have data
   - Other tabs depend on AI response

### Common Issues:

1. **No API Key**: You'll see "AI service not configured"
   - Solution: Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env.local

2. **Rate Limit**: You'll see "API rate limit reached"
   - Solution: Wait a few moments and try again

3. **Parsing Error**: Modal opens but tabs show no data
   - Solution: Check console for "Invalid property data" errors
   - The AI might not have extracted all required fields

## What's Been Fixed:

1. Added comprehensive logging throughout the data flow
2. Improved modal state management with useEffect
3. Added null checks to prevent rendering before data loads
4. Enhanced error handling and user feedback
5. Fixed timing issues with modal opening

## If Still Not Working:

1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check Network tab for API response
3. Verify the AI is returning all expected fields
4. Look for any JavaScript errors in console
5. Try with a simpler property description first

The issue was that the modal was opening before the data was properly set in state. The fixes ensure:
- Data is logged at every step
- Modal only opens when data exists
- State updates trigger re-renders properly
- All premium content sections are checked
