# Comprehensive Property Data Saving Documentation

## Issue Summary
The comprehensive property data (Strategic Overview, 30-Year Projections, Location Analysis, etc.) generated by AI analysis IS being saved correctly to the database/file storage, but was not visible when viewing properties.

## Investigation Results

### 1. Data IS Being Saved
- Confirmed by checking `/data/properties.json` - all comprehensive fields are present
- The `createProperty` function in `/src/lib/properties.ts` correctly saves all fields
- No data is being stripped during the save process

### 2. Display Issue
The problem was in how properties are displayed:
- The admin page uses `convertToDeal()` function to convert properties for display
- This function only extracts basic fields needed for the DealModal
- All comprehensive fields were being excluded from the view

### 3. Solution Implemented

#### Created ComprehensivePropertyView Component
- New modal component specifically for viewing all property data
- Includes tabs for:
  - Overview (basic info + financial metrics)
  - Strategic Analysis (strategicOverview + valueAddDescription)
  - Location (location analysis + rent analysis)
  - Financials (property metrics + financing scenarios)
  - 30-Year Projections (assumptions + projection table)

#### Updated Property Display Logic
- When clicking "View Details" on a property:
  - If property has comprehensive data → Show ComprehensivePropertyView
  - If property doesn't have comprehensive data → Show regular DealModal

## How It Works Now

1. **During AI Analysis**: All comprehensive data is generated
2. **In Review Modal**: User can see and edit all data before saving
3. **After Saving**: 
   - ALL data is saved to storage (confirmed)
   - Properties with comprehensive data show in ComprehensivePropertyView
   - Properties without comprehensive data show in regular DealModal

## Testing Instructions

1. Create a new property with AI analysis
2. Review all tabs in the review modal
3. Save the property
4. Click "View Details" on the saved property
5. Verify all comprehensive data is displayed in the new modal

## Data Fields Being Saved

### Basic Fields
- title, address, city, state, zipCode

## Verification

Or check the data file directly:
